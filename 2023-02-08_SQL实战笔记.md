### Part-1  SQL基础知识

#### 1.1 查询操作

- [ ] **检索数据**   

```SQL
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products
ORDER BY prod_name
```

- [ ] **过滤数据**   

```SQL
SELECT prod_name
FROM Products
WHERE prod_price = 3.49
``` 

- [ ] **函数**   

```SQL
  LENGTH ()
  UPPER ()
  LEFT ()
  RIGHT ()
  LOWER ()
  LTRIM ()
  RTRIM ()
``` 

- [ ] **分组数据**   

```SQL
SELECT vend_id, COUNT(*) AS num_prods
FROM Products
WHERE prod_price >= 4
GROUP BY vend_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
ORDER BY items, order_num
``` 

- [ ] **子查询**   

```SQL
SELECT cust_id
FROM Orders
WHERE order_num IN (SELECT order_num FROM OrderItems WHERE prod_id = 'RGAN01')
``` 

- [ ] **使用视图检索数据**   

```SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact
FROM ProductCustomers
WHERE prod_id = 'RGAN01';
``` 
***ProductCustomers**是一个视图*
*视图是虚拟的表。与包含数据的表不一样，视图只包含使用时动态检索数据的查询*

#### 1.2 表操作

- [ ] **创建表**   
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Products
(
	prod_id    CHAR(10)      NOT NULL,
	vend_id    CHAR(10)      NOT NULL,
	prod_name  CHAR(254)     NOT NULL,
	prod_proce DECIMAL(8,2)  NOT NULL,
	prod_desc  VARCHAR(1000) NULL
)
```  

- [ ] **更新表**   
```SQL
ALTER TABLE Vendors  
ADD vend_phone CHAR(20);
```  

- [ ] **删除表**   
```SQL
DROP TABLE CustCopy;
```  

- [ ] **简单联结**   
   
　**_方法一_**   

```SQL
SELECT vend_name, prod_name, prod_price
FROM Vendors, Products
WHERE Vendors.vend_id = Products.vend_id;
```  
*注意：在该情况下，要保证所有的联结都有 **WHERE**字句，否则会返回笛卡尔积 ( **cross join** ) 的不正确数据*  

　**_方法二_**  

```SQL
SELECT vend_name, prod_name, prod_price
FROM Vendors INNER JOIN Products
ON Vendors.vend_id = Products.vend_id;
``` 
*使用 **INNER JOIN** 联结时，联结条件用特定的 **ON** 字句而不是 **WHERE**字句*    
***ANSI SQL** 规范首选 **INNER JOIN** 语法*    

- [ ] **多个表联结**   
```SQL
SELECT cust_name, cust_contact
FROM Customers, Orders, OrderItems
WHERE Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id
AND OrderItems.order_num = Orders.order_num
AND prod_id = 'RGAN01';
``` 
*子查询并不总是执行复杂SELECT操作最好方法，使用联结查询往往会更有效*


- [ ] **使用带聚集函数的联结**   
```SQL
SELECT Customers.cust_id,
       COUNT(Orders.order_num) AS num_ord
FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.cust_id = Orders.cust_id
GROUP BY Customers.cust_id;
``` 
*函数调用 **COUNT ( Orders.order_num )** 对每个顾客的订单计数，将它作为 **num_ord** 返回*
***AS**用于使用表别名*

- [ ] **组合联结**   
```SQL
UNION
UNION ALL 
``` 
*使用 **UNION ALL** 不会取消重复的行*

#### 1.3 数据操作

- [ ] **插入数据**   
```SQL
INSERT INTO Customers(cust_id, cust_name, cust_address, cust_city, cust_state, cust_zip, cust_country)
VALUES('10005', 'Toy Land', '123 Any Street', 'New York', 'NY', '11111', 'USA');
``` 

- [ ] **更新数据**   
```SQL
UPDATE Customers
SET cust_email = 'kim@thetoystore.com'
WHERE cust_id = '10005';
``` 

- [ ] **删除数据**   
```SQL
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE cust_id = '10006';
``` 

### Part-2  SQL 实战

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-001    
[Employees Earning More Than Their Managers](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/)  

  → → → 方法一: INNER JOIN
```SQL
SELECT e1.Name AS Employee FROM Employee e1
INNER JOIN Employee e2
ON e1.ManagerId = e2.Id
AND e1.Salary > e2.Salary
```

  → → → 方法一: SELF JOIN
```SQL
SELECT e1.Name AS Employee FROM Employee e1, Employee e2
WHERE e1.ManagerId = e2.Id  AND e1.Salary > e2.Salary
```

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-002    
[Duplicate Emails](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-emails/)   

  → → → 
```MYSQL
SELECT Email FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING count(Email) > 1
```

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-003    
[Combine Two Tables](https://leetcode.com/problems/combine-two-tables/)   
  → → → 
```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Address
ON Person.PersonID = Address.PersonID;
```

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-004    
[Customers Who Never Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/)   

  → → → 
```SQL
SELECT Name AS Customers
FROM Customers 
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.ID = Orders.CustomerID
WHERE Orders.CustomerID IS NULL;
```

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-005    
[Rising Temperature](https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/)   
  → → → 
```SQL
SELECT t1.Id FROM Weather t1
INNER JOIN Weather t2
ON TO_DAYS(t1.Date)=TO_DAYS(t2.Date) + 1
AND t1.Temperature > t2.Temperature
```

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-006    
[Second Highest Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/)   
  → → → 方法一   
```SQL
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```

  → → → 方法二: 使用 **LIMIT**
```SQL
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM
    (
    SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee 
    ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1, 1
    ) AS c
```

*DINSTICT 经常和 ORDER BY 连用。*
*LIMIT 后可以跟一个或者两个数字参数，跟两个数字参数的情况，第一个参数是 Offset，第二个参数是 Limit 的个数。*
*Every derived table must indeed have an alias.* ( 每张派生表必须定义一个别名。)   


如下 e.g.
```SQL
SELECT MAX(age) 
FROM (
-- this part of the query is a derived table:
SELECT age FROM table
) as Age -- must give derived table an alias
```

  → → → 方法三: **NOT IN 或者 NOT EQUAL <>**
```SQL
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```
or
```SQL
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE Salary <> (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```

*首先使用 MAX 函数，找到最高工资：SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee。接着，排除最高的，再选出来就是第二高的。*   
*这是一个 subquery ，subquery 和 derived table 不同点是 Subquery 可以脱离主查询语句独立存在。最简单的分别 subquery 和 derived table 的方法：WHERE 跟 subquery，FROM 跟 derived table 且后面要加 alias。*   


- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-007    
[Delete Duplicate Emails](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/)   
  → → → 
```SQL
DELETE p1 FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.ID > p2.ID AND p1.Email = p2.Email
```

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-008

[解析思路](http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/database-sql/what-is-a-self-join/)    

  → → → Self Join
```MYSQL
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.ID + 1 = l2.ID
AND l2.ID + 1 = l3.ID
AND l1.Num = l2.Num
AND l2.Num = l3.Num
```


- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-009   ★★★★☆   
[Rank Scores](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores/)   

  → → → 方法一
```SQL
SELECT Scores.Score, COUNT(Ranking.Score) AS RANK
FROM Scores, 
   (
   SELECT DISTINCT Score
   FROM Scores
   ) Ranking
WHERE Scores.Score <= Ranking.Score
GROUP BY Scores.Id, Scores.Score
ORDER BY Scores.Score DESC;
```

  → → → 方法二: Subquery
```SQL
SELECT s1.Score, 
(
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(s2.Score)) FROM Scores s2
    WHERE s2.Score > s1.Score
) + 1 AS Rank
FROM Scores s1
ORDER By Score DESC
```

  → → → 方法三: Derived Table
```SQL
SELECT s1.Score, COUNT(s2.Score) AS Rank 
FROM Scores s1,
(SELECT DISTINCT Score FROM Scores) s2
WHERE s1.Score <= s2.Score
GROUP BY s1.Id
ORDER BY s1.Score DESC
```


- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-010    
[Department Highest Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/department-highest-salary/)   

  → → → 方法一: GROUP BY
```SQL
SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary
FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Department d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
AND e.Salary IN (
	SELECT Max(e2.Salary) From Employee e2
    WHERE e2.DepartmentId = d.Id
	GROUP BY e2.DepartmentId
)
```

  → → → 方法二: 
```SQL
SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary
FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Department d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE (e.DepartmentId, e.Salary) IN (
	SELECT e2.DepartmentId, Max(e2.Salary) From Employee e2
	GROUP BY e2.DepartmentId
)
```

  → → → 方法三: 
```SQL
SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary
FROM Employee e, Department d
WHERE e.DepartmentId = d.Id
AND (e.DepartmentId, e.Salary) IN (
	SELECT e2.DepartmentId, Max(e2.Salary) From Employee e2
	GROUP BY e2.DepartmentId
)
```

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-011    
[Nth Highest Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary/)   

    → → → 方法一: LIMIT
```MYSQL
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
	DECLARE M INT;
	SET M=N-1;
	RETURN (
SELECT DISTINCT Salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT M, 1);
END
```
*LIMIT 从句不能写成 ```LIMIT N - 1, 1``` ，因为 MySQL 的 LIMIT 后只能加数字参数，不能加变量。*
*MySQL 使用 SET 为变量赋值*


    → → → 方法二: Subquery  
```MYSQL
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary
      FROM Employee Emp1
      WHERE (N-1) = (
          SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Emp2.Salary))
          FROM Employee Emp2
          WHERE Emp2.Salary > Emp1.Salary)
  );
END
```

- [ ] LeetCode 练习题-012    
[Combine Two Tables](https://leetcode.com/problems/combine-two-tables/description/)   

  → → → 使用 **Left Join**     
```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State 
FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address
ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
```
*错误解法: 使用 **Where***   
*这道题要求的是 “regardless if there is an address for each of those people”，也就是不论 address 是否存在都返回解，所以这是 left join。而用 where 的结果这里会得到 inner join，只会得到有 address 情况下的解。*

ON TO_DAYS(w1.Date) + 1 = TO_DAYS(w2.Date) 
WHERE w1.Temperature < w2.Temperature
```

  → → → 方法二. SELF JOIN   
```SQL
SELECT w2.Id FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE TO_DAYS(w1.Date) + 1 = TO_DAYS(w2.Date) AND w1.Temperature < w2.Temperature
```
